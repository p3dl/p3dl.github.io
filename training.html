        <h1 id="prusa-training-manual">Prusa Training Manual</h1>
        <p>This document will outline how to print in our lab using the Prusa I3 Mk2. This guide will give you all the
          basic information you need to know to get from 3D model to a printed piece.</p>
        <h2 id="converting-model-to-gcode">Converting model to GCODE</h2>
        <p>This guide starts assuming that you have a 3D model ready to go. You can either design your own part from
          your favorite CAD software, and export it as an STL, or download a model from a source, such as
          https://www.thingiverse.com/.</p>
        <p>Now that we have our model, we need to convert it into code that the 3D printer knows how to deal with
          --g-code. G-code is a numerical control programming language that will tell the printer exactly how to move
          in order to print our piece.</p>
        <p>In order to convert this software, we are going to use <strong>Slic3r</strong>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>
            <p>Load the STL file into Slic3r.</p>
            <img src="./images/slicer_1.png" alt="slicer load" style="width: 50%;">
          </li>
          <li>Orient the object into your preferred orientation.
            <ul>
              <li>You can right click and move around different axes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Decide what fill density you want for &quot;solid&quot; volumes of your model.
            <ul>
              <li>0% is no infill. (Only the outer shell of the model will be printed)</li>
              <li>100% is fully infilled.</li>
              <li>15% is a standard infill for most print jobs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Decide if you need supports.
            <ul>
              <li>If there are any features that overhang by an angle of more than 45 degrees from vertical, supports
                are required.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Select if you want a brim.
            <ul>
              <li>A brim will print a 5mm brim around the layer, which will help with making the print stick to the bed
                better. This does not consume much time or material, so generally it's advisable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click &quot;Slice Now&quot;.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click &quot;Export G-code&quot;. <img src="./images/slicer_2_1.png" alt="slicer load" style="width: 90%;"></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="repetier-server">Repetier server</h2>
        <p>The printers are connected via a server. Although it is possible to print g-code from an SD card, the
          <strong>required</strong> way of printing is through the server.</p>
        <p>The server should only be accessed by the local printing computer.<br />
          The IP address is <strong>312.206.36.183:3344</strong>.</p>
        <p>You will get a user login to the Repetier server once you completed an orientation with Robert Turner or the
          TA.</p>

                propan-2-ol; commonly called 2-propanol or IPA)</em> and a fresh, disposable lint-free wipe. Don't

          <li>Once the print job has finished, you should remove the spring steel heatbed with the piece still

          <em>The button marked with an X immediately below the control knob is not used to cancel a command or go up a

                jerk the filament. If it doesn't remove completely and easily, seek assistance from the TA or RT.</li>
              <li>Do not let go of the end of the filament! Immediately secure it to the holes in the side walls of the
                spool. If you let go of the end it may snarl up, which will cause problems for the next person using

        <h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks</h2>
        <p>Remember, this is a brief outline of the printing procedure. If you have any reccomendations or additions
          that you think should be made, let us know.</p>
        <p>You may encounter some errors while printing (print falls off of heating bed, interruption, broken
          filament). If these happen, either check the FAQs on the website, or consult the Prusa documentation for the
          printer. Please inform us of any failed prints and any problems with the printer. We aim to improve the
          printer services and strive to provide reliable rinting.</p>
        <p>Log any issues or any major changes that you make, and stop printing immediately if a serious issue arises.
          Use software controls to cancel a print job. Do not just turn off the printer as this will stop the cooling
          fan to the filament, which may overheat.</p>
